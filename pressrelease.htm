<p>[prMac.com] Rancho Mirage, CA - Rancho Mirage, California — February 
3, 2012 — Today Cameron Johnson releases version 1.0.0 of Prayer Vault, 
an app for iPhone and iPad that can organize prayer requests. Notable 
features include the ability to import contacts and a clean, intuitive 
interface.<br>
<br>
Although brand new, Prayer Vault fills a much needed void in the 
Christian app market. Unlike many prayer tracking apps available in the 
app store, Prayer Vault focuses on simplicity of features and maintains a
 clean, elegant interface.<br>
<br>
Prayer Vault is $1.99 USD, and is available for all iOS devices with iOS
 5.0 and above. Users can add prayer requests for anyone in their 
contacts and have the ability to add notes, dates, and titles and can 
also choose between 20 categories. Once entered, prayers can be sorted 
by category, person, or date, and can be deleted or marked as resolved. A
 contact can be selected and communicated with directly from within the 
app.<br>
<br>
Prayer Vault focuses on graphics and simplicity. It is useful for anyone
 trying to organize their prayer life, but is specifically designed for 
the Christian market. Depending on user interest, new features will be 
added in the future including password protection and local reminders of
 upcoming prayers.</p>

simple design and ease of use. Cameron is currently a senior at Ouachita
 Baptist University in Arkadelphia, Arkansas where he is continuing to 
develop apps.</p>
